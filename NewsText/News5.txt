Cognizant at the WEF Economic Meeting: Elevating Cognizant’s stature on the world stage
I am so thrilled with everything our company accomplished at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting. This theme of gen AI as an equalizer played out in nearly every conversation I had in Davos—and I had scores of them. Our leadership team had more than 100 individual client and partner meetings over four days and (as conveyed by the photos in this message) hosted more than 130 guests at events in our Cognizant lounge. These 230-plus connections will drive future commercial opportunities, partnerships, and collaborations. I can’t think of a more productive way to build so many relationships so rapidly than through the activations the team executed at WEF. 
 WEF consists of far more than the January annual meeting in Switzerland. It’s a year-long flywheel of activity. The panel on which I participated was the culmination of a year-long collaboration among regulators, economists, academics, and industry leaders. Although we entered the conversation about halfway through the year, we quickly established ourselves as thought leaders. I believe our year-long engagement as a WEF strategic partner will be a virtuous cycle that will enhance our reputation and open new doors for our company.
